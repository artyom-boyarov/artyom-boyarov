## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Artyom Boyarov, a hard-working, curious, and well-rounded student at the University of Michigan (Go Blue!). My major is in Computer Engineering and my interests lie in Computer Hardware, Robotics, Nanotechnology, and Graphics.

# Projects
<br><i>Follow the link to each repository, where you'll find code, in-depth descriptions, pictures, videos, and more.</i>

- <a href="https://github.com/artyom-boyarov/trajectory-following-simulation">trajectory-following-simulation</a>: A simulation comparing control algorithms used to navigate an autonomous bus through an urban environment. I then used this simulation to carry out my first <a href="https://emerginginvestigators.org/articles/22-104">published</a> research project.
- <a href="https://github.com/artyom-boyarov/fpga-demos">fpga-demos</a>: ~8 working SystemVerilog HDL modules designed for the Xilinx Artix-7 based Basys3 FPGA board. These demonstrations use many of the board's peripherals and features such as the PS/2 interface, VGA port, switches, LEDs, 7-segment display, on-chip BRAM and debug cores.
- <a href="https://github.com/h1-Group-h1">Royal Automation</a>: During the 2021 Fox Hub accelerator program, I recruited and led a London-based team to develop a smart home automation system. Our system was focused on windows and blinds in the user's home: users could automatically open their windows and blinds at the press of a button in their smartphone app.
- <a href="https://github.com/umrover/mrover-ros">mrover-ros</a>: I'm an embedded software engineer at the University of Michigan's Mars Rover Project Team. In the past year, I've made the following contributions:
  - Spearheaded transition to MJBots Moteus brushless motor control board by studying CAN interface and writing a supporting C++ software library.
  - Clearly documented motor communication protocol and how to run, configure, and debug motors.
  - Produced reliable, user-friendly Python script to automatically configure new motors with pre-determined, optimal settings.
  - Learned Altium Designer and collaborated with team to design a new circuit board to improve collected sample analysis.
  - Upgraded firmware for STM32-based motor control board, employing novel C++20 features to improve performance.
- <a href="https://github.com/artyom-boyarov/Flashcards">Flashcards</a>: a QT5-based flashcards app, designed to mimic Quizlet's features to learn flashcards. (made in response to Quizlet requiring payments)
- <a href="https://github.com/artyom-boyarov/xamarin-converter">xamarin-converter</a>: A Xamarin.Forms app which converts between different units. When I get round to it, I'll make a .NET MAUI port of this.

Not everything I do can be published, but here is a description of other work I've done as part of internships and coursework:
- Software Engineering internship at Flex Technologies [London, UK, May-Aug 2023]:
  - Integrated new payment gateway (PaySera) with the companyâ€™s online Shopify store which reduced card payment processing cost by 50%. 
  - Developed Python software to automatically rectify orders entered incorrectly into courierâ€™s IT system; saved 5 failed orders monthly.
  - Learned and developed a Google Apps Script which cut the time required to update store prices during a sale by 2 hours.
  - Developed a Python script to synchronize inventory levels on the company website with those of wholesale suppliers. Saved employees up to 1 hour of work per day and enhanced company reputation with accurate live inventory data.
  - Configured Ubuntu Linux servers to run integrations. Automated tasks using `cron` and `systemd`.
- <a href="https://cs61c.org/">CS61C<a>: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (taken at UC Berkeley at age 16; achieved grade A):
  - Project 1: text parsing tool to replace words in a file. Implemented fully in C with CUnit-based unit testing.
  - Project 2: MNIST classifier implemented in RISC-V assembly and Python unittests for testing.
  - Project 3: RISC-V CPU core built out of logic gates in Logisim.
  - Project 4: Python extension written in C which provided accelerated linear algebra operations. Used vector intrinsics, parallelism, cache optimization and other techniques to speed up code.
- <a href="https://eecs280.org/">EECS 280</a>: Programming and Intro Data Structures (Fall 23 at U-M; grade A+). All projects were written in C++.
  - Project 1: Statistical processing/C++ refresher.
  - Project 2: Image processing.
  - Project 3: Interative Euchre game for 0-4 human players (remaining spots filled by AI).
  - Project 4: Templated linked list implementation.
  - Project 5: Natural language processing and machine learning with a simplified Multi-Variate Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier.
